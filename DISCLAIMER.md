# Legal Disclaimer and Terms of Use

**SFDA Regulatory Compliance Agent**
Last updated: 2026-09-24 · Version 1.0

> **Summary.** An AI pre-check agent for medical device submissions. This project is provided for **demonstration and testing purposes only**. It is **not** legal, regulatory or medical advice, and its output is not a regulatory clearance or approval. All content is sample content. **All responsibility for any use of this software, and all legal and regulatory obligations arising from it, rests solely with the user.**

## 1. General Disclaimer

### 1.1 Not Professional Advice

This software — including its source code, command-line tools, APIs, user interfaces, documentation, rule files, data files, prompts, reports and any output it produces (together, the **"System"**) — is provided for general informational, educational and testing purposes only.

No content produced by or contained in the System:

- constitutes legal, regulatory or medical advice;
- creates a lawyer–client, consultant–client or any other professional relationship;
- replaces the opinion of a qualified lawyer or regulatory affairs professional;
- may be used as the basis for any regulatory submission, registration, labeling, market-access, clinical or legal decision, contract or declaration;
- constitutes evidence before any court, arbitral tribunal, mediator, regulator or administrative authority.

If you have a legal or regulatory question, consult a licensed and qualified lawyer or regulatory affairs professional in the relevant jurisdiction.

### 1.2 Sample Content

All content in the System is **sample content only**, including:

- the regulatory clauses in `data/regulatory_corpus/` — **synthetic text** that does not reproduce official SFDA, UAE MOHAP or IMDRF text;
- the sample submission in `data/sample_submission/` — **fictional**, with placeholder names;
- regulation names, versions, dates, classes, timelines and requirements in the documentation — research notes **not verified** against official sources;
- prompts, findings, classifications and reports produced by the System.

None of it may be treated as definitive, current, complete or applicable to a specific situation, because:

- Medical device regulations differ between countries, emirates, free zones, authorities and sectors;
- they are amended, replaced and repealed over time, and new regulations, guidance documents and circulars are issued continuously;
- the facts of a specific case (product, parties, dates, location, sector) can fundamentally change the outcome;
- exceptions, exemptions and transitional provisions can override general rules.

### 1.3 Not a Regulatory Clearance

A result such as "no critical issues found" means only that the System found no issues against its sample corpus. It does **not** mean that a submission is complete, compliant or likely to be accepted, and it is not a regulatory clearance, approval, registration or certification of any kind. The System must not be used for clinical purposes or for any decision affecting patient safety.

The System is independent and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, sponsored by or connected to the Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA), the UAE Ministry of Health and Prevention (MOHAP), the Emirates Drug Establishment (EDE), the International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF), or any other government authority, regulator, free zone, standards body or company. Names of authorities, laws and standards are used for identification and reference only.

### 1.4 The User Is Solely Responsible

Every natural or legal person who uses the System (the **"User"**):

- must independently verify the accuracy, currency, completeness and applicability of any information, finding, classification, checklist, document list or answer obtained from the System, directly with the relevant authority;
- is **solely, entirely and irrevocably responsible** for:
  - all decisions made with or without the System;
  - all legal, regulatory, administrative, criminal, financial and commercial consequences of those decisions;
  - all obligations towards regulators, patients, customers, distributors and any other third party;
  - all actions taken or omitted in reliance on the System's output.

### 1.5 Disclaimer of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the authors, contributors, licensors and distributors of the System (the **"Developers"**) shall not be liable, under any legal theory (contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, product liability, statute or otherwise), for any loss or damage — direct, indirect, incidental, special, punitive or consequential — arising from:

- the use of, or inability to use, the System;
- errors, omissions, inaccuracies or outdated content in the System;
- any action taken or not taken in reliance on the System's output;
- the rejection, delay or withdrawal of any submission, registration or market authorization, and any penalty, recall or safety incident;
- the integration of third-party services (LLM APIs, vector databases, cloud providers);
- data loss, data breaches, unauthorized access or service interruption;
- the interpretation of the System's output by the User or by third parties.

## 2. Risks Specific to Artificial Intelligence

### 2.1 Large Language Models

When a Cohere API key is configured, the System uses a large language model to validate submissions against retrieved clauses and to explain findings. Large language models:

- can **hallucinate** — produce fabricated but persuasive content, including non-existent rules, clauses or citations;
- can reflect **biases** in their training data;
- can produce **outdated** information;
- can **guess** instead of expressing uncertainty;
- can perform **inconsistently** across languages, in particular with Arabic regulatory terminology;
- can cite sources **out of context** or **incorrectly**.

### 2.2 Safeguards and Their Limits

The System includes the following safeguards:

- **Retrieval-grounded prompts** — the model is given only clauses retrieved from the sample corpus;
- **Tool-based clause lookup** — the model can look up a clause's text before citing it;
- **Post-process citation check** — a citation to a clause that was not retrieved is replaced with "(unverified)";
- **Structured output** — findings are parsed from JSON with fixed fields.

**These safeguards reduce risk; they do not eliminate it:**

- a finding whose citation was replaced with "(unverified)" is still shown — it has **no verified source** and must be treated as unreliable;
- the citation check confirms that a cited clause was **retrieved**, not that the finding is **correct**;
- the regulatory corpus is synthetic and incomplete;
- retrieval can miss the relevant clause or return the wrong one;
- the model can misjudge whether a document satisfies a requirement;
- prompts and rules are written by humans and can contain errors.

**No output of the System may serve as the basis for any regulatory, legal or clinical decision without review by a qualified professional.**

### 2.3 Acceptance of AI-Related Risks

By using the System, the User acknowledges that AI-assisted and rule-based output is inherently uncertain and may contain errors, agrees not to rely on it as the sole basis for any decision, assumes all risk for decisions based on it, and — to the maximum extent permitted by law — waives any claim against the Developers arising from such errors.

## 3. Data, Third-Party Services and Privacy

### 3.1 Data Sources

The System does not connect to any official regulatory source. The regulatory corpus in `data/regulatory_corpus/` was written for demonstration and testing; it is **synthetic** and does not reproduce official text. Regulatory references in the documentation are research notes that have not been verified.

The Developers do not guarantee that any data in the System is accurate, current or complete, or that it matches any official text.

### 3.2 Third-Party Services

When configured, the System uses the **Cohere API** (chat, embeddings and rerank). Optional components may use **ChromaDB** and open-source embedding models.

These services are subject to their own terms of use, privacy policies and data processing terms. The Developers are not responsible for the acts, omissions, outages or data breaches of any third-party service, and any data sent to them is sent at the User's own responsibility.

### 3.3 Privacy and Data Protection

When an API key is configured, the System sends submission data, document names and retrieved clauses to the third-party LLM provider.

The User:

- **must not** enter personal, sensitive or confidential data, including patient data, personal data of employees or customers, unpublished technical files, trade secrets or real submission documents;
- must anonymize any real data before using it with the System;
- is responsible for securing all files the System writes locally (reports and any logs);
- is solely responsible for compliance with applicable data protection laws, including UAE Federal Decree-Law No. 45 of 2021 (PDPL), the Saudi Personal Data Protection Law and the EU GDPR where applicable.

The Developers give **no warranty** of compliance with any data protection law.

---

## 7. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Developers' aggregate liability for all claims arising from or related to the System is limited to the amount the User paid for the System. The System is provided free of charge; where nothing was paid, the Developers' liability is **zero**.
